Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are systems that use advanced technologies and communication technologies in transportation and traffic management systems to improve the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of transportation networks, reduce traffic congestion, and enhance driver experiences ¹²³⁴ .

ITS includes various tools, facilities and expertise such as information technology, software technology, hardware and telecommunications that are used to monitor, control, safety and improve the performance of the transport fleet.

How does ITS affect the environment?
ITS, as an intelligent transportation system, can have various effects on the environment. Among these effects, we can mention the reduction of traffic and air pollution, reduction of fuel and energy consumption, improvement of transportation efficiency, reduction of traffic accidents, etc. ¹²³.

In general, ITS can help improve the quality of the environment, but it should be noted that some ITS systems may also increase traffic and air pollution.

How does ITS reduce fuel consumption?
ITS, or intelligent traffic control and transportation systems, includes all information technologies, telecommunications, control, system engineering, as well as strategies, management decisions, and coordinating mechanisms, which, as a result of their application, improve transportation parameters. and transportation and traffic such as reducing travel time, fuel consumption and increasing safety
